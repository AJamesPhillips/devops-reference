# Serverless LocalStack Example [![serverless](http://public.serverless.com/badges/v3.svg)](http://www.serverless.com)

This project is a TypeScript based API generated using [create-awesome-node-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-awesome-node-app). However, it is recommended to generate your own project using the command and following the options in the interactive menu. Please refer to the documentation for more information.

We use Serverless Framework to do production ready deployments and local development using
_serverless-offline_.

## Features

- ü¶æ [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Ensures type safety
- üåê API Gateway - Build scalable and maintainable APIs
- ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Management - Manage different environments and configurations
- üìú Logging - Implement logging for debugging and monitoring purposes
- üß™ Unit Testing - Write and execute unit tests to ensure code quality

## Pre-packed with

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - JavaScript and JSX linting utility
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - Opinionated code formatter
- [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) - Simplifies Git hooks setup
- [lint-staged](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lint-staged) - Runs linters against staged git files, preventing üí© from slipping into your code base!

## Requirements

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Composer](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 18 or later

  **You‚Äôll need to have Node 18 or later on your local development machine** (but it‚Äôs not required on the server). You can use [fnm](https://github.com/Schniz/fnm) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

## Quickstart

```sh
# Setup NodeJs and install dependencies
fnm use
pnpm install

# Run the Local Stack using Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d

# Set env variables and run the serverless offline
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="dummy-value"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="dummy-value"
pnpm run sls:offline
```

## Testing locally

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/ --header 'Content-Type: application/json' --data '{
  "content": "console.log(\"Hello World\");",
  "filePath": "example/file.js"
}'
```

Then run the following command to check the uploaded file:

```sh
# Set the AWS credentials
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="dummy-value"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="dummy-value"

# List the uploaded files
aws --endpoint-url=http://localhost:4566 --no-verify-ssl s3 ls --recursive serverless-localstack-bucket
# 2023-10-31 18:00:00         18 example/file.js
```

## Development

While developing, you will mostly rely on `pnpm run dev`; however, there are additional scripts available:

| `pnpm run <script>` | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sls:offline`       | Serves your app locally for development                    |
| `format`            | Formats the project using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) |
| `lint`              | Lints the project for potential errors                     |
| `lint:fix`          | Lints the project and fixes all correctable errors         |

## Production

Available scripts:

| `pnpm run <script>` | Description                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `sls:package`       | Builds the application to the `.serverless/` directory |
